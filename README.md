# Rerun
Rerun is a tool to run shell commands and GUI applications by just typing the command. It comes with a few unique features too:

 1. Support for Switchable Graphics using PRIME.
 2. Run applications as Root, including Graphical Applications.

Seriously, that's it. And I'm not even sure if that's useful now.

### Obviously abandoned. o_o
